 I gave a talk on [Computational imaging: Restoration deep networks as implicit priors]() at the [Deep Reconstruction Workshop](https://aiai.jhu.edu/deep_reconstruction_workshop_2025) that took place at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) (see the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCoRSC9BMPI)).
