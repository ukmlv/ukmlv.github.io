We've been awarded $998,638 in NSF funding for our collaborative project [Robustness to Distribution Shifts in Computational Imaging: Inference, Sampling, and Adaptation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2504613&HistoricalAwards=false). The project, in collaboration with [Prof. Salman Asif](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2504614&HistoricalAwards=false), will begin on October 1, 2025.
