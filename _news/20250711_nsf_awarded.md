I've been awarded $478,638 in funding for a new NSF project [Robustness to Distribution Shifts in Computational Imaging: Inference, Sampling, and Adaptation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2504613&HistoricalAwards=false). The project will begin on October 1, 2025 and will run for four years. A sister project will be conducted by Salman Asif at UC Riverside.
