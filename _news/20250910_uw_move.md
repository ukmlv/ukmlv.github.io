Friends, I have a major career update! After 8 wonderful years at [WashU ESE/CSE](https://engineering.washu.edu/index.html), my team and I will be moving to [UW-Madison ECE](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering).

I'm excited to collaborate with amazing new colleagues at UW, and will truly miss WashU and St. Louis‚Äîplaces where I‚Äôve built many great memories. ü¶°‚ù§Ô∏è
